# Form pages
Form pages is an extension of the regular pages with page parts ([KunstmaanNodeBundle](https://github.com/Kunstmaan/KunstmaanNodeBundle), [KunstmaanPagePartBundle](https://github.com/Kunstmaan/KunstmaanPagePartBundle)). With the form pages it is possible to create a frontend form which exists out of a mix of form page parts and regular page parts. When the form is submitted a thank you message will be shown, an administrative mail will be sent and a formsubmission will be created.

There are two possibilities to create form pages, you can implement the `Kunstmaan\FormBundle\Helper\FormPageInterface` or you can extend the `Kunstmaan\FormBundle\Entity\AbstractFormPage` which has most of the functionality already implemented. To handle the form creation and the submission of the form you can use the `kunstmaan_form.form_handler` service.

The `kunstmaan_form.form_handler` uses the `kunstmaan_form.form_mailer` to sent the administrative mails. It is possible to create your own mailer for this by implementing `Kunstmaan\FormBundle\Helper\FormMailerInterface` and configuring your new class in the config file `kunstmaan_form.form_mailer.class`. It is also possible to configure your own FormHandler service by implementing `Kunstmaan\FormBundle\Helper\FormHandlerInterface` and configuring the class in the config file `kunstmaan_form.form_handler.class`.
