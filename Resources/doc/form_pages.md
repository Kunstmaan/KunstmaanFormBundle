# Form pages
Form pages is an extension of the regular pages with page parts ([KunstmaanNodeBundle](https://github.com/Kunstmaan/KunstmaanNodeBundle), [KunstmaanPagePartBundle](https://github.com/Kunstmaan/KunstmaanPagePartBundle)). With the form pages it is possible to create a frontend form which exists out of a mix of form page parts and regular page parts. When the form is submitted a thank you message will be shown and a formsubmission will be created.
